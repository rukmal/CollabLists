This was a project for the 2014 Facebook Seattle Regional hackathon.

## Description

```
Life is too short for bad music
```
This app is focussed on a very real problem:  bad music at parties.

Using Socket.io, with a rock-solid web server tin the form of ExpressJS, this app serves exactly that purpose. It allows users to add, vote on and delete music from a playlist at a party.
